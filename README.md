OBS Studio Themes
=================

About
-----

These are themes for OBS Studio, version 30.2.0 or higher,
following the [OBS Studio Theme System](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/OBS-Studio-Theme-System).
The themes technically are so-called OBS Variant Theme (OVT) files
for the standard OBS Base Theme (OBT) `Yami`. They provide simple
base "dipped" colorings in Grey, Blue, Brown, Green and Red of OBS Studio user
interface, mainly intended to optically better differentiate multiple portable
OBS Studio instances.

Installation
------------

1. Clone this repository:<br/>
   `git clone https://github.com/rse/obs-themes`

2. Copy the `*.ovt` files to your OBS Studio
   `data/obs-studio/themes/` directory.

3. Select the theme under **Settings** / **Appearance** / **General**
   with **Theme** `Yami` and **Style** `Dipped XXX`.
